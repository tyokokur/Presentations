*Presentation Notes*

* Introduction
- Polymer brushes are defined by physically fixing one end of a polymer chain
  onto some substrate.
- In neutrally charged brushes, brushes extend vertically into the solution
  above some threshold grafting density. There, the steric hinderance resulting
  from surrounding chains exceeds the entropy loss experienced from s.
