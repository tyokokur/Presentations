*Presentation Notes*

* Introduction
- Polymer brushes are defined by physically fixing one end of a polymer chain
  onto some substrate.
- In neutrally charged brushes, brushes extend vertically into the solution
  above some threshold grafting density such that the entropic penalty of
  chain stretching is less than t
