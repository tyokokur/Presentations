* Introduction
- Polymer brushes are defined by physically fixing one end of a polymer chain
  onto some substrate.
- In neutrally charged brushes, brushes extend vertically into the solution
  above some threshold grafting density. There, the steric hinderance resulting
  from surrounding chains exceeds the elastic entropy loss from
  stretching the chain.
- In charged polymer, or polyelectrolyte, brushes, the inherent charges on the
  chains governs brush height instead of the short-range monomer-monomer
  interactions.
- In both neutral and charged brushes, the only conformat
